1. Count the number of digits in a number  
   This works for both positive and negative numbers.  
    Limited by the max value that can be stored in an integer variable.
2. Reversing a number  
   Takes the number. Removes the last digit. Adds that to  
   10 times the reversed number in a while loop.  
   Note that if the original number ends in 0, then  
   that digit is left off of the reversed number.
3. Do while loop.  
   Allowing a max of 3 PIN guesses before locking.
